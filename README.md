# A few things...

This site is best viewed on a 1440p display. If you do not have one, it may be simulated with the Chrome Developer Tools.

This can be activated on macOS with the following shortcut:

Cmd + Shift + C

This can be activated on Windows with the following shortcut:

Ctrl + Shift + C

In the top center of the screen youll have the option to select a 1440p viewing screen. The site also looks good in 1024p and 768p.

I attempted to make the site responsive with an unfamiliar framework, Bootstrap 5. There is clearly a lot more that I need to learn about Bootstrap, but I wanted to use an unfamiliar framwork to show that I am capable of obtaining quick knowlege about any given framework and apply that knowlege to a project.

I know my implematation is not perfect. But I hope that you can appeciate the hard work that I put into this assessment.

Thank you for the opportunity!
