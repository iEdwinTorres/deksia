# A few things...

This site is best viewed on a 1440p display. If you do not have one. it may be simulated with Chrome Developer Tools. this can be activated on macOS with the following shortcut:

Cmd + Shift + C

on Windows with:

Ctrl + Shift + C

I attempted to make the site responsive with an unfamiliar framework. (to me) I used Bootstrap 5. There is clearly a lot more that I need to learn about Bootstrap, but I wanted to use an unfamiliar framwork to show that I am capable of obtaining quick knowlege about any given framework adn apply that knowlege to a project.

I know my implematation is not perfect. But I hope that you can appeciate the hard work that I put into this assessment.

Thank you for the opportunity!
