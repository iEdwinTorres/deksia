# A few things...

This site is best viewed on a 1440p display. If you do not have one, it may be simulated with the Chrome Developer Tools.

This can be activated on macOS with the following shortcut:

Cmd + Shift + C

This can be activated on Windows with the following shortcut:

Ctrl + Shift + C

In the top center of the screen you'll have the option to select a 1440p viewing screen. The site also looks good in 1024p and 768p. All 3 of these resolutions may be selected by clicking on the appropriate sections to either side of the resolution display as shown below.

I attempted to make the site responsive with an unfamiliar framework, Bootstrap 5. There is clearly a lot more that I need to learn about Bootstrap, but I wanted to use an unfamiliar framework to show that I am capable of obtaining quick knowledge about any given framework and apply that knowledge to a project.

I know my implementation is not perfect. But I hope that you can appreciate the hard work that I put into this assessment.

Thank you for the opportunity!
